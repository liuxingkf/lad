7. \textbf{(4 pt) Binary Search.}

A binary search finds the position of a value in a sorted array. The basic idea is to compare the value with the middle element of the array.

\begin{itemize}
\item If the target value is less than the middle element, then the left half of the array is searched.
\item If the target value is greater, then the right half is searched.
\item Otherwise, the target value is matched and the middle index is returned.
\end{itemize}
